ABOUT STANFORD UNIVERSITY CODE IN PLACE 2021:-

Code in Place is a free introductory programming course using the Python language, based on material from the first half of Stanford University's established intro course, CS106A. It assumes no prior programming experience. You should expect to be working 10 to 20 hours a week. This experience is different from typical free online courses for a few reasons. We hope these help you have a great Code in Place experience: You will meet in a small group, once a week, with someone on the teaching team. The course is centered around engaging assignments and an optional final project.

Code in Place 2021 was an endeavour by a group of educators and volunteer teachers from all over the world to teach introductory programming to over 12,000 students. Based on Stanford University's CS 106A, the course taught the fundamentals of programming in Python.

As part of their coursework, students had the opportunity to work on a final project of their own design. The task was to work on a problem that interested them using the skills they developed over the course of Code in Place. We saw an incredible variety of work demonstrating the breadth of perspectives and experiences the students brought with them. This website is a celebration of these projects, and of the time and effort our students spent getting here.
